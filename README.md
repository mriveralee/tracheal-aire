An open-source Williams Airway Intubator.  Using OpenJSCAD (openjscad.org), this script takes in a numer of parameters about a patient's throat and can generate a 3D model, exportable to STL (binary or ASCII), AMF, and X3D formats.

This intubator is availble in classic form, with the shape modeled after existing Williams Airway Intubators, and an experimental form, which reverses the typical curved portion on a standard Williams Airway Intubator.
